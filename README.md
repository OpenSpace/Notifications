# Notifications
A repository that contains notifications that are displayed in the Launcher of OpenSpace. Apart from the GitHub-specific files (README.md and LICENSE.md), each other file in this repository contains the contents for notifications of a specific version or the master branch. The file for the `master` branch must be named `master.txt` and the files for specific versions should be named with the full version number with the `.txt` extension. For example the file containing the notifications for version 0.21.0 should be called `0.21.0.txt`, the one for 0.21.1 should be called `0.21.1.txt` etc.

If a notification message is important for multiple versions, it must be added to each file individually.
